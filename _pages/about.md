As the majority of patients do not take or decide to quit the prescribed medication during 1-year period and one of the main reasons is observed side effects of medication, we decided to assess this issue by reminding the general practitioners when they should switch the medication. Furthermore, this plugin would not require a lot of general practitioner’s time as it would be able to memorise provided impute and to track changes of the patient’s condition.
