Diabetes mellitus, a prevalent metabolic condition, impacted 537 million individuals globally in 2021, constituting a prevalence of 10.5%. Projections indicate a significant rise, with an anticipated 783 million cases by 2045, resulting in a prevalence of 12.2%. The substantial increase highlights the growing public health challenge posed by diabetes.

Identification of diabetes involves recognizing specific symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, blurred vision, weight loss, poor wound healing, and recurrent infections. Despite these recognizable signs, diabetes can manifest without symptoms, leading to over 40% of adults worldwide remaining undiagnosed. This prevalence varies widely across regions, ranging from 24% to 75%. This silent nature of the condition underscores the importance of proactive screening and awareness campaigns.

To better understand abnormal glucose metabolism, it is categorized into two clinical groups: diabetes and pre-diabetes. These classifications are based on biochemical definitions, forming the foundation for diagnostic and preventive measures. The delineation between these categories is crucial for early intervention, emphasizing the significance of both clinical recognition and biochemical assessments in managing the spectrum of glucose-related disorders.
