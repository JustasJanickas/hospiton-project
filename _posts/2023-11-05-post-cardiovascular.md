When gauging cardiovascular (CV) risk in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), a comprehensive assessment is imperative. Considerations encompass medical and family history, symptoms, examination findings, laboratory results, and the existence of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) or severe Target Organ Damage (TOD). Robust evidence is lacking to support the notion that assessing Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) or Intima Media Thickness significantly aids in reclassifying CV risk for those with T2DM.

Severe TOD is delineated as:
<ul>
  <li>Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m², regardless of albuminuria, or</li>
  <li>eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m² with microalbuminuria (Urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio [UACR] 30–300 mg/g; Stage A2), or</li>
  <li>Proteinuria (UACR >300 mg/g; Stage A3), or</li>
  <li>Presence of microvascular disease in at least three distinct sites (e.g., microalbuminuria (Stage A2) coupled with retinopathy and neuropathy; refer to Section 9.1 for Chronic Kidney Disease [CKD] screening).</li>
</ul>
