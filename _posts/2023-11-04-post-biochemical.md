<h2> Fasting Glucose </h2>
Diabetes diagnosis is established with fasting glucose levels equal to or exceeding 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). Typically, two tests are recommended for diagnostic confirmation in the absence of hyperglycemic symptoms. Symptomatic patients require only a single test, with fasting defined as no caloric intake for a minimum of 8 hours. Criteria for pre-diabetes diverge: WHO suggests 6.1–6.9 mmol/L (110–125 mg/dL), while ADA adopts a more stringent range of 5.6–6.9 mmol/L (100–125 mg/dL).

<h2> Two-Hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and Random Glucose </h2>
Diabetes is diagnosed with OGTT if 2 h glucose is equal to or exceeds 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). OGTT results ranging from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L (140–199 mg/dL) indicate impaired glucose tolerance, marking pre-diabetes. Random glucose equal to or exceeding 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) is diagnostic for diabetes with symptoms; without symptoms, two random glucose levels equal to or exceeding 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) are required. Some propose a 1-hour OGTT equal to or exceeding 8.6 mmol/L (155 mg/dL) as a superior predictor of diabetes, but validation is needed.

<h2> Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) </h2>
Diabetes is diagnosed with HbA1c equal to or exceeding 48 mmol/mol (6.5%). Divergent pre-diabetes criteria: WHO suggests HbA1c ranging from 42 to 47 mmol/mol (6.0–6.4%), while ADA recommends a wider range of 39–47 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%). A combination of HbA1c and fasting glucose in the diabetes range is diagnostic, obviating the need for a second test if asymptomatic. Discordant results prompt repetition or, preferably, an OGTT, considered the gold standard in ambiguous cases. HbA1c is praised for its simplicity, limited variability, and convenience, but limitations exist in specific groups and regions with restricted test availability.

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
Criteria for diagnosing diabetes and pre-diabetes exhibit variations, underscoring the importance of a nuanced approach, symptom consideration, and the selection of appropriate biochemical tests. The choice between fasting glucose, OGTT, or HbA1c hinges on the clinical context, highlighting the significance of a comprehensive diagnostic strategy.
